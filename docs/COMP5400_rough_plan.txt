COMP5400 Plan:

Topic: Game of Life

-----------------------------------------------------

Relevant Prompts: 
Implement the Game of Life in BEAST, Unity or other platform
Implement or experiment with an existing implementation of Conwayâ€™s Game of Life (if
using an existing framework). 

OR 

Write a critical exploration of conway's Game of Life

-----------------------------------------------------

Ideas:
 - Begin by implementing the vanilla game using framework of choice
 - Introduce different types of cells that interact with other cells via different rules
 - Make cells who's outcomes depend on more complex criteria than simple rules
    - Cells with sensing capabilities?
    - Cell outcomes could be probabalistic instead of certain - then probability can be configured/influenced.
 - Make other objects that can influence the outcome of cells.
 - Refer to course material for swarm/bio concepts and try to adjust the behaviour of cells
   to model these concepts
 - Create a sandbox allowing the user to experiment with different rules, parameters and place
   objects in the world before running the game
   - Menus, drag and drop
 - Create presets that demonstrate bio concepts - can have accompanying documentation to 
   demonstrate understanding

---------------------------------------------------------

Frameworks:
- Unity
- Godot
- Pygame *
- Phaser (browser)

------------------------------------------------------

Mini-Report: Some references on game of life, critical -> intro presentation

------------------------------------------------------

Presentation

Timeline:
11th/12  - Good baseline vanilla game
22nd April - Implementation mostly complete
    - Set out initial project structure
    - Grid size scalable, rules, cell -> rules,
1st May - fully focussed on report/presentation
